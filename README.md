**Abstract**:\
In distributed systems, accurate time synchronization is vital for maintaining consistency and coordination among nodes. Traditional Network Time Protocol (NTP) often suffers from high synchronization delays, especially in large-scale systems with many nodes and high network latency. These delays can lead to inconsistencies in data replication and hinder time-sensitive operations. This paper proposes the use of Chrony Sync, a more efficient time synchronization method, to significantly reduce synchronization times. By optimizing synchronization, Chrony enhances system performance, consistency, and reliability in large distributed environments.

**Key Contributions:** 
* **Algorithm Development** \
  Designed and optimized Chrony sync time algorithm to achieve high write availability in distributed systems.
* **Performance Comparison** \
  Conducted bench marking between NTP Sync time and Chrony sync time.
* **Reserach Leadership** \
  Led the research and technical implementation , focusing on advancing distributed database through algorithm innovation.

**Relevance & Real-World Impact**
* **Kubernetes infrastructure optimization:**\
    Enhances distributed key-value store performance by improving the write availability in distributed systems.
